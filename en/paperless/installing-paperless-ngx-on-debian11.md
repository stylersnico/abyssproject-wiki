# Introduction

The goal here is to set up an Electronic Document Management system with the Open source product Paperless-NGX.

> We won't talk about external access here since the system doesn't have two factor authentication right now.

# Docker Installation

Â 
Install the prerequisites:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release sudo -y
```

Set-up Docker Repository and Docker: 
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" |  tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

apt-get update && apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
```

Set-up Docker Compose V1:
```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
 chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version
```

# Creating Paperless User

Create the Linux user for Paperless:
```bash
adduser paperless
```

Add it to the mandatory group and connect to it: 
```bash
usermod -aG sudo paperless
usermod -aG docker paperless
su - paperless
```


# Paperless Installation

Launch the following script to install Paperless:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/master/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"
```


Some options will be needed. Personally, I like to keep media, data and database off a docker volume, directly on the file system for more simple backups:

> Enable Apache Tika if you would like to add more files than simple PDF into your EDM (Office documents for example).

## Automatic update of the system

If you would like to automate the update process of the system (you should do it), install Watchtower:
